Xfce4-Mpc-Plugin
----------------

This is a simple Musicpd (http://www.musicpd.org) client plugin for the Xfce 4.4 panel.
To build it, you must have libmpd libraries and headers installed. 
Get'em from your OS' repository/ports, or from source here : http://cms.qballcow.nl
If libmpd is not installed in a standard directory, use --with-libmpd.

./configure (--prefix=.. --with-libmpd=..) && make && su -c make install should suffice.
